# cloudscape1
Created with CodeSandbox


Pros
- slot system seems cool, prebuilt components have alot of fucntionality built in, decent documentation
- same as MaterialUI with radio(select only 1 item) and checkbox(select multiple items) 
- opinionated on how to do things, could be a good or bad thing. Working with form reminded me of the Remix framework.
- I think responsiveness is built in already. 


Cons
- Making changes seems to break live reload
- date picker prebuilt components, cant go granular with mins and seconds. Need to use Time input. Material Ui date time picker much better
- still need to research on how much we can customize these prebuilt components and how to theme
- SX prop in MaterialUi allows a good amount of customization in styling
- Inability to target single components using console using inspect. Styles are converted to minfied js, hard to debug. 
- Can't figure out how to do a flexbox. 
- cloudscape is kind of new so hard to find good results when searching a problem.
- Tables? kind of hard
